# MediaHome

MediaHome is a self-hostable homepage for all your media services. MediaHome is not meant as a competitor to homelab dashboards like [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) or [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage). Rather, it is meant to be accessed from a dedicated HTPC to provide a fast and simple way to access content.
